# Proof of Existence

### A Year-Long Collective Art Experiment

> "Leave your trace. Co-create history. Prove you existed."

History was once a luxury for the few. Kings in stone. Conquerors in epics. Poets in ink. They were written into the blockchain of their time.

But what about you? In the digital noise, we are ghosts. A server crashes, a platform dies, and our footprints vanish into the void.

**Proof of Existence is the modern Epic.**

An immutable ledger where your trace—no matter how small—is carved into the block, forever.

## The Vision

Proof of Existence is a collective art experiment running through 2026. Every participant co-creates the final digital monument. We invite you to leave an immutable light trail on the blockchain, proving you were here.

## Explore
