# PROOF OF EXISTENCE: THE MODERN EPIC

## 1. The Philosophy: Why We Are Here

### The Forgotten and The Eternal

In the annals of history, immortality was a privilege reserved for the very few. Kings carved their names into stone; conquerors wrote themselves into epics; poets were immortalized in ink.

But for the rest of us—the billions who lived, loved, and struggled—history is silent. We are ghosts.

In the digital age, this impermanence has accelerated. A server crashes, a platform shuts down, a subscription expires—and our digital footprints vanish into the void. We spend thousands of hours online, creating, interacting, living, but when the power is cut, it all returns to zero.

**Proof of Existence (POE)** is a rebellion against this silence.
It is a movement from "Digital Nomadism" to "Digital Permanence." It is a cryptographic mechanism to ensure that your presence, your time, and your energy are not ephemeral ghosts, but permanently inscribed history.

### The Modern Epic

We are building the **Modern Epic**.
Unlike the epics of old, written by one for the glory of one, this is a collective masterpiece written by millions.

- **You are the Hero:** Your every movement is a verse.
- **The Blockchain is the Stone:** An immutable ledger that cannot be erased.
- **The Archive is Eternal:** Stored on Arweave, the permaweb, to be witnessed by digital archaeologists centuries from now.

## 2. The Mechanism: How It Works

This is not just an art project; it is a protocol for capturing "Proof of Life."

### Step 1: Connect

You connect your Soulbound Wallet. This is your digital ID, your unique identifier in this metaverse.

### Step 2: Enter the Void

You enter an infinite, dark 3D space—our "Global Canvas." Here, time is the only metric.

### Step 3: Inscribe

When you move your cursor, you are not just drawing lines.

- The system captures your position vectors `(x, y, z)` and timestamps `(t)` with millisecond precision.
- Every hesitation, every burst of speed, every circle reflects your subconscious state in that moment.
- These data points are transformed into a unique "Light Trail."

### Step 4: Mint & Immortalize

We offer a "Dual-Path" minting mechanism to accommodate both the general public and collectors:

**1. Standard Proof —— [Free]**
Ideal for general participants.

- **Mechanism:** Your data is temporarily stored on our servers and batched into a Merkle Tree for daily on-chain submission at UTC 00:00.
  - **Storage:** The full data batch is uploaded to **Arweave/IPFS** by the protocol, ensuring decentralized backup.
- **Reward:** You earn **Time26** tokens as "Proof of Time."
- **Cost:** **0 Gas**. We cover all Gas and storage expenses.

**2. Perpetual Proof —— [Paid]**
Ideal for crypto-natives and collectors.

- **Mechanism:** Your trail is immediately written to **Arweave** and verified by the **Polygon** smart contract in real-time.
- **Benefits:**
  - Instantly mint your personal Trail **NFT**.
  - Earn the "Instant Minter" badge.
  - Fully decentralized data ownership, independent of official servers.
- **Cost:** A small fee is required (see "Pay to Exist" below).

## 3. Technical Architecture

To deliver on the promise of "Lasting for Ages," we chose the most robust decentralized tech stack.

| Layer         | Technology                | Role                                                                                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interface** | **Next.js 16 + Three.js** | Provides immersive 3D interaction using WebGL for high-performance rendering.            |
| **Consensus** | **Polygon (PoS)**         | Ensures fast confirmation and low costs, acting as the final arbiter of ownership.       |
| **Storage**   | **Arweave**               | The "Permaweb." Once uploaded, data is stored permanently, theoretically for 200+ years. |
| **Identity**  | **Clerk**                 | Seamless Web3 login experience, bridging the traditional and decentralized worlds.       |

**Why Arweave?**
Traditional cloud storage (AWS, Google Cloud) is "rent-based"—stop paying, and data is deleted. Arweave is "endowment-based"—pay once, store forever. It is the only choice for building a digital legacy.

## 4. The Economy: Time as Currency (Tokenomics)

### Time Token (Time26)

**Time26** is the ecosystem's native token, representing the "attention time" contributed by the community.

- **Symbol:** $TIME26
- **Total Supply:** 48,420,000
  - _Concept:_ 2026 has 31,536,000 seconds. We extended this "year" to account for the collective energy of the community and team committed during the inception (approx. 1.54 years of time).

### Why 48,420,000? (The Time Math)

This number is composed of the "Base Year" plus the "Ecosystem Extension":

**1. The Base Year**

- **31,536,000 (65%)** = **User Rewards**
  - Matches every second of 2026 (365 Days). This is purely for the creators.

**2. The Ecosystem Extension**
The "extra time" added to support the project's infrastructure (Total 16,884,000):

- **10,000,000 (21%)** = **Liquidity Pool**
  - For Uniswap and markets, ensuring Time26 can be traded.
- **4,730,400 (10%)** = **Team**
  - Incentives for builders and long-term maintenance.
- **2,153,600 (4%)** = **Operations Reserve**
  - Server costs, event rewards, and emergency funds.

**Total:** 31.5M (Users) + 16.9M (Ecosystem) = **48,420,000**

### How to Earn Time26? (Mining)

You can earn tokens for free via **"Existence Mining."**
Your earnings depend on the time you invest and the congestion of the sector you are in.

**Scarcity Formula:**
`User Reward = Σ (1 Time26 / Number of people in that sector at that second)`

- If you draw in a crowded "Times Square" area, you earn very little Time26.
- If you draw in a desolate wilderness, you earn the full value of that time.
- This incentivizes the even distribution of light trails across the canvas.

### The Cost of Eternity

Choosing "Perpetual Proof" requires a fee to cover the real costs of permanent Arweave storage and Polygon verification. This is a **"Time Deposit"** for the future.

We have established a duration-based pricing tier:

| Interaction Duration | USDC Price | Time26 Payment (20% Discount) |
| :------------------- | :--------- | :---------------------------- |
| **< 10 Minutes**     | $2.00      | ~160 $TIME26                  |
| **10 - 30 Minutes**  | $5.00      | ~400 $TIME26                  |
| **30 - 60 Minutes**  | $10.00     | ~800 $TIME26                  |
| **1 Hour +**         | $20.00     | ~1,600 $TIME26                |

_Note: Time26 prices are adjusted in real-time via oracle to maintain an approx. 20% discount._

### The Sustainability Valve

We reject the "Pump and Dump" cycles of traditional crypto. We built a **Dynamic Valve** into the heart of the protocol.

1.  **Deflation Mode (Phase A):**
    - _When:_ Early stage or stable supply.
    - _Mechanism:_ 100% of Protocol Revenue (e.g., the $2-$20 fees mentioned above) is used to buy back and **BURN** $TIME26 from the open market.
    - _Result:_ Scarcity increases. Your "held time" becomes more valuable.

2.  **Sustainability Mode (Phase B):**
    - _When:_ Supply drops too low (<30M) or price spikes unsustainably.
    - _Mechanism:_ 20% Burn / 80% Treasury.
    - _Result:_ The Treasury gains sufficient funds to prepare for the **2027 Global Exhibitions**, ensuring the project survives beyond the hype cycle.

## 5. The Future: 2027 and Beyond

The project does not end when 2026 ends. That is merely the pause after the first movement.

### 2026: The Recording Phase

- **Q1-Q2:** Protocol launch, Genesis blocks drawn.
- **Q3-Q4:** "Gravity Field" events begin, community co-creation of massive thematic canvases.

### 2027: The Exhibition Phase

On **January 1, 2027**, the canvas will be sealed.

- **Global Tour:** Your trails will be projected in immersive galleries in New York, Tokyo, and London. This will be the largest "Decentralized Generative Art Exhibition" in history.
- **Physical Totems:** Every proof holder will be eligible to mint a physical "Time Capsule," containing a holographic projection of their trail.

### 2028+: The Eternal Archive

All data remains on Arweave, becoming the largest record of behavioral art in human history.
Future AIs and historians will interpret our era's anxieties, hopes, and collective consciousness through these trails.
