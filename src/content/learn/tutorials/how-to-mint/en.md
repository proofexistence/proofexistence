# Choosing Your Proof Type: Standard vs Perpetual

You've just created a beautiful light trail. Now comes an important decision: **how do you want to preserve it?**

![Perpetual Proof Example - Light trail artwork stored on Arweave](https://gateway.irys.xyz/DnRkJQhB3EWmZjgoeu8wPPvXo4s5JxGANE6FKUV2YCY)
_This is an example of a Perpetual Proof. Your light trail creation can be permanently preserved on the blockchain like this._

This guide will help you understand the difference between Standard and Perpetual proofs, so you can make the choice that's right for you.

## Which Proof Type Should I Choose?

### Choose Standard Proof (Free) if you...

- Want to participate in the 2026 experiment without spending money
- Don't need instant verification
- Are okay with your proof being part of a daily batch
- Want to try the platform before committing financially
- Care more about the experience than owning an NFT

**What you get:**

- Your trail is cryptographically verified on the Polygon blockchain
- Included in the collective artwork
- Visible on the Explore page and Cosmos
- Proof that you existed at this moment in 2026

**Trade-offs:**

- Verification happens at midnight UTC (not instant)
- No NFT ownership—you can't trade or sell it
- Storage is managed by the protocol, not decentralized

---

### Choose Perpetual Proof (Paid) if you...

- Want to **own** your creation as a digital asset
- Need **instant** on-chain verification (within seconds)
- Want your trail stored **permanently** on decentralized storage
- Plan to showcase it on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea
- Want to support the project financially
- Care about having a collectible badge on your profile

**What you get:**

- An ERC-721 NFT minted directly to your wallet
- Permanent storage on Arweave (survives even if our servers go down)
- Instant verification—no waiting until midnight
- Exclusive "Perpetual Proof" badge on your profile
- Full ownership—you can transfer, sell, or hold forever
- Higher visibility in the community

## How Much Does Perpetual Proof Cost?

Pricing is designed to be fair based on how long your trail is:

| Trail Duration | Cost                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| 10-45 seconds  | Base fee only             |
| 46+ seconds    | Base fee + per-second fee |

**Example:** A 60-second trail costs: `Base fee + (60-45) × per-second rate`

The first 45 seconds are included in the base fee, so shorter trails are more affordable.

## Payment Options: Which Should I Use?

### Option 1: POL (Polygon Token)

**Best if you:** Already have crypto in your wallet

- Pay directly with Polygon's native token
- Requires signing a transaction in your wallet
- You'll need enough POL to cover the cost + small gas fee

**How to get POL:**

- Buy on exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, etc.)
- Bridge from Ethereum
- Use a fiat on-ramp service

---

### Option 2: TIME26 Token

**Best if you:** Want to use tokens you earned on the platform

- Our native token for the 2026 experiment
- Earn by inviting friends (referrals) and engaging with proofs
- Can be claimed from your pending rewards

**How to get TIME26:**

- Share your referral link—earn when friends join
- Engage with proofs (like, save, view)
- Participate in community events

---

### Option 3: Gasless Minting (Unclaimed TIME26)

**Best if you:** Have unclaimed TIME26 rewards and want the easiest experience

- Use your pending TIME26 balance directly
- **No wallet signature needed**—completely gasless!
- The smoothest minting experience

**How it works:**
Your unclaimed TIME26 rewards can be spent without ever claiming them to your wallet. This means no gas fees and no transaction signing—just click and mint.

## Step-by-Step: Minting a Perpetual Proof

### Before You Start

- Make sure you're [logged in](/learn/getting-started/first-proof)
- Have payment ready (POL, TIME26, or unclaimed balance)
- Create a trail you're proud of—this is permanent!

### The Minting Process

1. **Create your trail** on the [Canvas](/canvas)
   - Draw for at least 10 seconds
   - Take your time—this will be forever on the blockchain

2. **Click "Submit Proof"**
   - You'll see the proof type selection screen

3. **Select "Perpetual Proof"**
   - Review the cost shown for your trail duration

4. **Choose your payment method**
   - POL: Direct payment from wallet
   - TIME26: Use claimed tokens
   - Gasless: Use unclaimed balance (recommended if available)

5. **Personalize your proof (optional but recommended)**
   - **Artwork Title**: Give your creation a name
   - **Description**: Describe what inspired you
   - **On-chain Name**: The name shown publicly (or stay anonymous)
   - **Message to the World**: Leave words for future generations

6. **Confirm and mint**
   - For POL/TIME26: Sign the transaction in your wallet
   - For Gasless: Just click confirm—no signature needed!

7. **Wait for confirmation**
   - Usually takes 5-15 seconds
   - You'll see a success message when complete

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I upgrade a Standard Proof to Perpetual later?

No, once submitted as Standard, it cannot be upgraded. If you think you might want a Perpetual Proof, choose it at submission time.

### What if I don't have any crypto?

Use social login (Google, Facebook, etc.)—a wallet is created for you automatically. You can still submit Standard Proofs for free, or earn TIME26 through referrals to mint Perpetual Proofs without buying crypto.

### Is my Perpetual Proof really permanent?

Yes. The NFT is on Polygon (a secure blockchain), and the artwork/metadata is on Arweave (permanent decentralized storage). Even if Proof of Existence shuts down, your proof survives.

### Can I sell my Perpetual Proof NFT?

Yes! It's a standard ERC-721 NFT. You can list it on OpenSea, transfer it to friends, or hold it forever.
