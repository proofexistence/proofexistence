# Create Your First Proof

Welcome to Proof of Existence! This guide will walk you through creating your very first light trail—a permanent record of your existence on the blockchain.

## What You'll Need

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- That's it! No crypto knowledge required.

## Step 1: Login / Connect Wallet

Visit [proofexistence.com](/) and click "Login / Connect Wallet" in the top right corner. You have two options:

### Social Login (Recommended for beginners)

Sign in with your existing account:

- Google
- Facebook
- Apple
- Line
- X (Twitter)

**No crypto wallet needed!** When you sign in with social login, Web3Auth automatically creates a secure blockchain wallet for you. You become a Web3 user without any technical setup.

### External Wallet

If you already have a crypto wallet, you can connect:

- MetaMask
- WalletConnect
- Other Web3 wallets

## Step 2: Enter the Canvas

Click [Draw to Proof](/canvas) to enter the 3D canvas. You'll see a dark space—this is your creative playground.

## Step 3: Draw Your Light Trail

- **Click and hold** anywhere on the canvas to start drawing
- **Move your mouse** while holding to create your trail
- **Release** to pause drawing
- Draw for at least **10 seconds** to create a valid proof

Your trail is a unique artistic expression that will be permanently recorded. Take your time and create something meaningful!

## Step 4: Submit Your Proof

Once you've drawn for at least 10 seconds, click "Submit Proof" to choose your proof type:

### Standard Proof (Free)

**Best for:** Everyone who wants to participate without spending money.

| Feature          | Details                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Cost**         | Completely free                 |
| **Verification** | Batched daily at UTC 00:00      |
| **Technology**   | Merkle tree aggregation         |
| **On-chain**     | Yes, via daily batch settlement |
| **Storage**      | Protocol-managed                |

**How it works:** Your proof is combined with others created that day into a Merkle tree. The root hash is submitted to the Polygon blockchain at midnight UTC, cryptographically proving your trail existed at that time. This efficient batching means you pay nothing—the protocol covers the gas fees.

### Perpetual Proof (Paid)

**Best for:** Those who want instant verification and full ownership as an NFT.

| Feature          | Details                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Cost**         | POL or TIME26 tokens                     |
| **Verification** | Instant (within seconds)                 |
| **NFT**          | Yes, ERC-721 token minted to your wallet |
| **Storage**      | Permanent on Arweave (decentralized)     |
| **Badge**        | Exclusive collector badge                |

**How it works:** Your trail is immediately uploaded to Arweave (permanent, decentralized storage) and minted as an NFT on Polygon. You receive full ownership of your proof as a tradeable digital asset, plus an exclusive badge for your profile.

**Pricing:** Base fee + per-second fee for trails longer than 45 seconds. The first 45 seconds are included in the base fee.

**Payment options:**

- **POL** - Polygon's native token
- **TIME26** - Our project token (earn through referrals and engagement)
- **Gasless minting** - Use unclaimed TIME26 balance with no wallet signature needed

## What's Next?

After submitting, you can:

- View your proof on the [Explore](/explore) page
- Share it on social media (X, Threads, Instagram)
- Find it in the [Cosmos](/cosmos) 3D visualization
- Download a screenshot to save or share

Congratulations! You've just left your permanent mark on the blockchain. Welcome to the 2026 collective art experiment.
