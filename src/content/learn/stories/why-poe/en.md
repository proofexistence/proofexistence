# Why Proof of Existence?

## The Problem with Digital Existence

In the age of social media, we create more content than ever. Yet most of it disappears—deleted posts, expired stories, forgotten feeds. Our digital existence is ephemeral.

History was once a luxury for the few. Kings were immortalized in stone. Conquerors in epics. Poets in ink. But what about you?

## A Year-Long Experiment

Proof of Existence is a collective art experiment running throughout 2026. Every participant contributes to a shared digital monument—a permanent record of humanity's creative expression.

Each light trail you draw becomes part of the Cosmos, an ever-growing 3D visualization where every proof lives forever.

## The Technology

We use blockchain technology not for speculation, but for what it does best: creating immutable records.

- **Polygon** provides fast, low-cost transactions
- **Arweave** ensures permanent storage
- **Merkle trees** enable efficient batch verification

## Join the Movement

This isn't about creating the next digital collectible. It's about leaving a trace—proof that you existed, that you created, that you were here.

Will you be part of the 2026 monument?
